# Deminvincibility
A stripped out version of the "Keep 1 Health" section of [Props](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/user/18746-props/)' [DadGamerMode](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/926-dad-gamer-mode) ([click here for repo](https://github.com/dvize/DadGamerMode)).

With explicit permission from Props, this is being released as a standalone BepInEx mod based off of his as a learning experience for me to dive into BepInEx modding.

## Features
Currently, the following features are implemented:
- Keep 1 Health (on / off)
- Keep 1 Health selection (Head, Thorax, Head & Thorax, All)
- % damage received (means you will only take X% of the actual damage you receive)
- May be more in the near future

## How do I install this?
1. Download [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) (most likely the top option: `64-bit Windows x64`)
2. Open `Deminvincibility.zip` with 7-Zip
3. Drag and drop the `BepInEx` folder straight into your SPT folder (where `Aki.Server.exe` is)
4. Profit
